## Summary

- The second book of the Silo series behind *Wool*. This book mainly looks at the backstory behind why the Silo exists and how they were built. The story follows Donald (Donny), a (senator?) from the state of Georgia, as he works with Thurman (another senator?) and Thurman's daughter Anna, who was Donald's girlfriend in college.
- The threat of nanorobots, tiny robots that travel through the bloodstream, is at large. While America has used this technology for good to repair damaged cells, other countries like Iran have weaponized it to destroy cells, demonstrated with a town in Israel.
- To protect humanity, Thurman unearthed a design Donald created in Architecture school for a hundred-story self-sustainable skyscraper and chose a plot in Georgia to build fifty of these buildings as underground bunkers instead of skyscrapers.
- Donald and Anna work together over several years to oversee the construction of all these silos, much to Donald's wife Helen's dismay.
- Once completed, the silos are publicly labeled as nuclear waste containment centers. A festival takes place above them, named after each silo. Donald tries to contact Helen from above the Georgia silo, eventually realizing she is at the Tennessee silo. He attempts to reach her but is held back by Anna and his sister Charlotte. The timeline ends with massive explosions, possibly thunder.
- The story continues in 2110 in Silo 1 with Troy, who leads a monotonous life managing communication with the de facto leaders of the other 49 silos. Silo 1 uses hibernation technology and is composed solely of men.
- During Troy's first 'shift', one silo goes into rebellion. He begins to remember fragments of his past life, including his wife Helen, and stops taking his medication, making irrational decisions. He is eventually taken to 'deep freeze,' reserved for people deemed unlikely to be useful.
- Troy wakes up a century later in 2210, revived by 'Thaw Man', later revealed to be Thurman. He joins a task force with Anna (the only woman allowed outside deep freeze) to investigate simultaneous rebellions across silos. Thurman realizes Troy remembers details from his previous life, including names and relationships.
- While Anna prepares for a funeral, Donald gains access to a computer and searches for his wife in the Tennessee silo, discovering she had renamed herself Karma (after their dog), married, and had descendants over 150 years. Donald is devastated by this revelation.
- Anna discovers what Donald has done, closes the computer, and hugs him to offer comfort.
