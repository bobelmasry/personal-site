## Summary

- A story set in a hundred-level underground bunker called the Silo where thousands of people live. The main protagonist, Jules, looks for reasons why the Silo exists, how it was built, and if it's safe outside the Silo.
- Throughout the Silo, only a handful of people know the secrets behind it. Most people are governed by *The Pact* and *The Order*, books intentionally written to maintain order and prevent rebellion. The Silo has a very Orwellian vibe: people are afraid to ask questions, and all citizens are monitored through cameras hidden in apartment mirrors.
- The story shows that eventually people will uncover secrets and that human curiosity is inevitable.
