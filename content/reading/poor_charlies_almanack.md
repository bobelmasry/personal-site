## Notes

- An interesting book full of life wisdom based on Charlie Munger's life and his work as a lawyer and as vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway.
- The first third or so of the book are various passages on Charlie: some by his kids while most are by people he worked with. The remainder is on various talks he held, so there is repetition between the different talks.
- An incredibly interesting thought process that Charlie uses is relating different fields through what he calls **mental models**, where each field has a couple of general ideas that sort of encompass the entire field. Some of the models he mentions are **Criticality Theory** from physics and **permutations and combinations** from math.
- Another thing I found fascinating is Charlie's breadth of knowledge. In the book, he references authors ranging from **Cicero** to **Pascal** and **Aristotle** to **Jack Welch**.
